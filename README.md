# Retail Sales and Customer Demographics Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset containing retail sales transactions and customer demographics. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we will derive insights, forecast sales, and understand customer behavior. The dataset includes various features such as transaction details, customer demographics, and geographical information.

In todayâ€™s competitive retail landscape, understanding customer behavior and sales trends is crucial for success. This project seeks to harness the power of data analysis and machine learning to explore a comprehensive dataset that encompasses retail sales and customer demographics.

By analyzing transaction data, customer profiles, and geographical information, we aim to uncover actionable insights that can inform marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, and enhance customer experience.

### Key Objectives

- **Purchasing Behavior Analysis**: Understand how new customers differ in purchasing behavior from returning customers, identifying trends and customer preferences.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Use clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, enabling targeted marketing campaigns.
- **Product Recommendation System**: Develop a product recommendation system using K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) to enhance cross-selling and upselling opportunities.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Build time series models to predict future sales, helping retailers prepare for demand fluctuations.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction**: Predict the total value a customer will generate over their lifetime to identify high-value customers and tailor retention strategies.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Analyze how factors such as age, gender, and geographical location influence product preferences, transaction size, and purchase frequency.

By leveraging these insights, retailers can make data-driven decisions to improve customer acquisition, retention, and revenue generation, resulting in a more personalized and efficient retail experience.
Join us on this journey to transform raw data into meaningful strategies for success in the retail sector!

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Date**: Date when the transaction occurred.
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Product Category**: Category of the purchased product (e.g., Electronics, Clothing).
- **Quantity**: Number of units purchased.
- **Price per Unit**: Price of one unit of the product.
- **Total Amount**: Total monetary value of the transaction.
- **Geographical Information**: (To be added)

### Potential Data Enhancements

Additional features and modifications to the dataset will be implemented to address specific business questions, including:

- **Customer Demographics**: Age, gender, location (city, province, region) to help segment and understand customer preferences.
- **Product Preferences**: Linking product categories to demographic data to uncover preferences for specific groups.
- **Transaction History**: Incorporating past transactions to predict customer behavior, such as whether a customer will make repeat purchases.
- **Price Sensitivity**: Adding a column to analyze how price changes impact customer purchasing behavior within product categories.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and matrix manipulations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for modeling and prediction.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Data visualization tools to create graphs and charts.
- **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab**: Interactive development environment for analysis and visualization.
- **Power BI**: Business intelligence tool for dashboard creation and visual analysis.

## Analysis and Predictions

### Key Business Questions

- **How does the purchasing behavior of new customers differ from that of returning customers?**  
  We will analyze transaction patterns and differences in purchase frequency, category preferences, and transaction amounts.

- **Are certain product categories more popular with specific genders?**  
  By segmenting customers by gender, we can identify which product categories are more frequently purchased by men or women.

- **Which product categories contribute the most to overall revenue?**  
  We will identify top-selling product categories based on total revenue and explore how different demographic groups impact these sales.

- **How does the average transaction amount differ by gender across various product categories?**  
  Gender-based comparisons will be made to identify trends in purchasing behavior, including average transaction values in different product categories.

- **Can we predict the quantity of items a customer will purchase in a single transaction based on their demographics and previous transaction history?**  
  Using regression models, we will predict the quantity of items a customer will likely purchase, factoring in their demographics and historical purchases.

- **Can we classify whether a customer will make repeat purchases based on their demographics and transaction history?**  
  A classification model will be used to predict whether a customer is likely to make repeat purchases, enabling proactive engagement strategies.

- **How frequently do customers make purchases, and does transaction size impact the frequency?**  
  By examining purchase frequency and transaction sizes, we will uncover insights into customer behavior and spending habits.

- **Do customers tend to purchase from multiple categories in the same transaction?**  
  Market basket analysis will be used to identify patterns in customers buying products from multiple categories in a single transaction.

- **How sensitive are customers to changes in price within specific product categories?**  
  Price sensitivity analysis will be performed to understand how price fluctuations influence customer purchase decisions across different categories.

- **Is there any relationship between the categories purchased and the total amount spent?**  
  We will explore correlations between product categories purchased and total transaction amounts to uncover key purchasing patterns.

### Predictive Modeling

- **Sales Forecasting**: Time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) will be used to forecast future sales based on historical trends.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) will be used to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, enabling targeted marketing campaigns.
- **Recommendation System**: K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) will be used to build a product recommendation system that suggests products based on customer purchase history and preferences.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Regression and classification techniques will be used to predict the CLV of customers, helping identify high-value customers.

## Data Preparation

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies in the dataset.
  - Normalize data for consistent analysis, particularly in demographic variables (e.g., age, gender).
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Extract date-based features (e.g., month, weekday) to understand seasonal patterns.
  - Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by aggregating customer transaction data over time.
- **Handling Missing Values and Outliers**:

  - Missing values will be handled using imputation or removal depending on the nature of the data.
  - Outliers will be detected and addressed to avoid skewed analysis and predictions.

- **Normalization and Encoding**:
  - Normalize numerical variables for consistent scaling across features.
  - Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, product category) using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

## Conclusion

This project aims to transform raw retail sales and customer demographic data into actionable business insights. By employing machine learning techniques, we will not only uncover trends in customer behavior but also build predictive models that can forecast sales, recommend products, and predict customer lifetime value. The insights generated will assist retailers in optimizing their marketing, inventory, and sales strategies, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and driving growth.
