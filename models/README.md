# 🌟 SARIMA Model for Time Series Forecasting

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the use of SARIMA for forecasting time series data. The script performs model selection, trains the best model, and evaluates its performance. 🧰

## Key Components
### Data Preparation:
- The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and features are engineered. 📊
- Missing values are handled, and categorical variables are converted into numerical using one-hot encoding. 🔄
- Added Canadian holidays and seasons to see how sales get influenced by holidays. 🎉
- Seasonal patterns like month, quarter, day of week, and holiday status are included as features. 

### Model Evaluation:
- A function `evaluate_sarima` is used to test different SARIMA configurations. 📉
- Metrics like **MASE**, **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **R-squared** are calculated for each model configuration. ✅

### Best Model Selection:
- A grid search approach is used to find the best model parameters. 🔍
- The best model is chosen based on the lowest MASE value **(0.61)** 🏆

### Forecasting:
- The best SARIMA model is fitted and used to forecast future values. 📅
- The forecasts are compared with actual test data to evaluate the model’s accuracy. 🎯

### Visualization:
- Results are visualized using **Matplotlib**, including the training data, test data, and forecasted values with confidence intervals. 📉📈

## Future Recommendations
To further enhance model accuracy:
- Test alternative models like ARIMA, ETS, and Prophet for different pattern capture. 🔍
- Use ensemble methods such as stacking or averaging predictions from multiple models. 🤖
- Explore neural networks like LSTM or GRU to capture complex relationships. 🧠
- Experiment with different feature sets and combinations to better model the data. ⚙️
- Regularly tune model parameters and validate using cross-validation to avoid overfitting. ⏳

## Conclusion
By implementing these recommendations, you can improve the accuracy and reliability of your time series forecasting models. The script provided offers a foundation to build upon and further customize based on specific requirements. 🚀
